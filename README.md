Retroweb :: 90fy the Web!
=========================

Retroweb is an example project to show off the function library for 90fying the
web!  Don't you miss the good old days of marquee, background gradients, and
animated gifs?  Are you sad that most browsers no longer support `<blink>`? Well
fret no more!

Retroweb provides an array of helper functions that aid in your quest for
internet nostalgia!

Example:

## Slow Loader
Retroweb tries to search for all images on a page and pipes them through a proxy
which slows the loading time to simulate a true 90s feel for web image loading.
After searching for a while, I couldn't quite find a proxy that slowly streamed
the data to the client (most try to be as fast as possible, pfft), so I made a
really simple one that does that, feel free to check it out:

## Future Work

 * `tablefy` function; will turn `<div>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` tags into tables!
 * More background choices.
 * Midi/MP3 playback support.
 * Easy Guestbook
 * Easy Visitors Counter
 * Mouse Trail Text
 * Best Viewed by Internet Explorer or Netscape
 * Gifify
   * Take a list of pictures and a framerate, simulate a gif animation with them.
 * Nyan cat flying around.
