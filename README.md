## Retroweb :: 90fy the Web!

Retroweb is an example project to show off the function library for 90fying the
web!  Don't you miss the good old days of marquee, background gradients, and
animated gifs?  Are you sad that most browsers no longer support `<blink>`? Well
fret no more!

Retroweb provides an array of helper functions that aid in your quest for
internet nostalgia!
